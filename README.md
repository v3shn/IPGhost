## IPGhost

IPGhost is a strong tool for ethical hackers. It helps you stay private and anonymous online by using the Tor network. This tool automatically changes your IP address, making it hard for anyone to track your online activities.

## Features

- Automatic installation of required dependencies (`Tor`, `curl`,`jq`).

- Changing your IP address regularly through Tor to stay anonymous.

- Display of the current Tor-routed IP address after every IP address change.

- Display of the location details (Country, Region, and City).

- User-defined IP address change interval and cycle count (or infinite mode).

- Automatically stops the Tor service upon exit to prevent unnecessary resource usage.

- SOCKS proxy setup instructions for routing your applications through Tor.

## Requirements

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, tested on Kali Linux).

- Root privileges to install dependencies and manage the Tor service.

- Active internet connection.

## Installation

**Step 1: Download and Install**

1. **Clone the repository or download the files:**
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-r-e-e-r-a-j/IPGhost.git
```
2. **Navigate to the IPGhost directory**
   
```bash
cd IPGhost
```
3. **Navigate to the IPGhost directory**
   
```bash
cd IPGhost
```
4. **Run the install.sh script to set up IPGhost:**

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

Then Enter `y` for install.

## Usage

**Step 1: Start IPGhost**
After installation, start `IPGhost` by running:

```bash
sudo ipghost
```

**After running the tool, it will automatically install necessary dependencies (Tor, curl, jq).**

**Step 2: Configure SOCKS Proxy**

To route your internet traffic through Tor, configure your applications to use the Tor SOCKS proxy:

- **Proxy Address:** `127.0.0.1`

- **Port:** `9050`

#### Example Configuration:

- **Firefox:**

1.Go to `Settings > Network Settings > Manual Proxy Configuration`.

2. Set **SOCKS Host** to `127.0.0.1` and **Port** to `9050`.

3. Select SOCKS v5.

4. Save the settings.

## How It Works

1. **Start Tor Service:** **IPGhost** automatically starts the Tor service when launched.

2. **IP Change:**

- Prompts the user for an IP address change interval (default: 60 seconds) and the number of IP address changes (0 for infinite).

- Reloads the Tor service to change identity and fetches the new IP address.

3. **Monitor New IP:**

- Displays the Tor-assigned IP after each IP address change.

- Shows location details (Country, Region, and City) in green color for better visibility.

4. **Stop Tor on Exit:**

- When IPGhost exits, it automatically stops the Tor service to conserve system resources.
